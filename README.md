Data Modeling Analysis: (ERD Deagram.png)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the database schema, showing how entities like **Employee**, **Department**, **Salary**, **Title**, **EmployeeDepartment**, and **Manager** are related. Each entity has attributes, and the relationships between them are depicted by connecting lines. This ERD serves as a blueprint for designing the database structure and its relationships.


Data Engineering Analysis: (Table_creation_Query.sql)

The data engineering phase involves creating database tables based on the schema and importing data from CSV files. Each table stores specific information, such as employee details, departments, salaries, job titles, and managerial relationships. Tables are designed with appropriate data types, primary keys for unique identification, and foreign keys to enforce relationships. Constraints like NOT NULL ensure data integrity.


Data Analysis: (EmpQueryAnalysisOutput.sql)

Data analysis involves querying the database to extract insights and answer key questions. SQL queries are used to retrieve information like employee details, hire dates, manager data, department assignments, and last name frequency. These insights help organizations understand workforce demographics, hiring trends, departmental structures, and managerial hierarchies, enabling informed decision-making and operational optimization.
